# Introduction
This documentation is automatically generated by `raydoc`. If you see any errors, [open an issue](https://github.com/pyrretsoftware/raydocs/issues/new). The base struct for this page is %%BASE%%.

The field types in this documentation are declared just like go types, here's a quick rundown on how those work:
### Types
There are two different kinds of types, basic types and structs. Structs have a specific structure and all the structs used by the base struct (%%BASE%%) is documented on this page. Basic types are:
- [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science))
- [bool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type)
- [int](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science))
- [int64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(computer_science))
- [float32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Floating-point_numbers)
- [float64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Floating-point_numbers)
- [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)

Note that when setting a byte array ([]byte) in JSON, you will need to use a base64-encoded string as there is no byte array data type in JSON.

### Arrays
[Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)) are denoted as an open and closing bracket followed by a type. For example, `[]string` would be an array of strings. In JSON form:
```json
["a string", "another string", "yet another string"]
```

### Maps (Dictionaries)
[Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) are denoted as the keyword "map" followed by a type enclosed in brackets. This first type is the type of the **key**. This is followed by another type, which is the type of the **value** For example, `map[string]bool` would be a map/dictionary where the keys are strings and the values are booleans. In JSON form:
```json
{
    "first key" : true,
    "second key:" : false,
    "3rd key" : true
}
```
