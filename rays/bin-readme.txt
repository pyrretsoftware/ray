Thanks for installing a ray server installation package. To get started, use the docs online or see the steps below.

1. Move the rays binary to the place on your system you want ray server to be installed to. We recommend a directory like '/usr/bin' on linux or '%USERPROFILE%' on windows, as they are already in your system's PATH variable.
2. On linux, make the rays binary executable with 'chmod +x rays'
3. Launch the setup utility with './rays setup' on linux (bash) or 'rays setup' on windows (cmd)
4. Optional: Add the directory rays now been installed in to your systems PATH variable if you want to be able to use the 'rays' command globally.
