# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of right now, no vulnerabilties have been found and so all versions are supported from a security sense, but versions below 2.0.0 may contain bugs.
## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can use [this page](https://github.com/pyrretsoftware/ray/security/advisories) to report vulnerabilties, for high severity vulns, you may also contact me through:
* discord: username is **axellse**, make sure to send a **message request** since i usually ignore friend requests.
* pyrret security: security@pyrret.com
* personal security: security@axell.me (please avoid, meant to be used for other things)

The issue will likely be fixed and a security patch released as soon as i have time to check my pc. I usually reply within a week unless i'm on vacation, but please remember that ray is provided "as is" with no warranty. This is an open source hobby project.

No bug bounties are awarded, but you will get credit!
